# GettingandCleaningData
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This repo contains: 
1) a tidy data set (tidy.txt), 2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis (run_analysis.R) and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
